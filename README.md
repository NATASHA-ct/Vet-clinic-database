# Vet Clinic-database
This repository houses my Vet Clinic relational database project. It accepts SQL commands to create a database, create tables, update tables, and run queries. It contains information about animals in a veterinary clinic, such as their pet names, weight details, and date of birth. PostgreSql was used to create this database.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
